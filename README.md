# Solana Vault

A demonstration application showcasing common web2 security vulnerabilities in a web3 context. This project is designed for educational purposes to help developers understand and identify security vulnerabilities in web applications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This application contains **intentional security vulnerabilities** and should **never** be used in production. It is designed solely for educational purposes to demonstrate common security issues in web applications.

**DO NOT** use real credentials or connect real wallets to this application.

## üéØ Project Overview

Solana Vulnerable Bank is a web application that simulates a banking system with Solana wallet integration. The application intentionally includes various security vulnerabilities commonly found in web applications, including:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- File Upload Vulnerability
- Broken Authentication
- Broken Access Control
- Security Misconfiguration
- Insecure Deserialization
- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Session-based
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Basic understanding of web security concepts

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5wnstar/solana_web2_vuln
cd solana_web2_vuln
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask init-db
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
